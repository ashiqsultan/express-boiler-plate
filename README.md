# Simple Express Boiler Plate

This is a simple boiler plate for developing API using Express JS.
Since Express doesn't restrict you to a specific directory structure, you can develop apis using it in any way you desire. I developed this boiler plate to set myself a directory structure to follow in my projects.

## What's included ?

- Directory structure for versioning api
- Logging using Morgan

# How to start

```
npm start
```

Calls the server.js file to start the application.
